Consider the govering equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
\left( \begin{array}{c} p(z) \\ 0 \end{array} \right) =
 \left( \begin{array}{c} \sigma_y \\ \tau_{xy} \end{array} \right) =
\int_0^{\infty} \left(
\begin{array}{cc} K_{11}(x-z) & K_{12}(x-z) \\ K_{21}(x-z) & K_{22}(x-z) 
\end{array} \right)
 \left( \begin{array}{c} g'(x) \\ h'(x) \end{array} \right) dx
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq2}
h^2p'=\lambda
\end{equation}
Have the ``input'' parameters as 
\begin{itemize}
\item BC's $P$, $M$ (or equivalently $g'$, $h''$ at $x\to\infty$)
\item $\lambda$ , the speed
\end{itemize}
Want to solve for the toughness $K_I$ and $K_{II}$. In this project,
we have so far focused on $K_I$.
\begin{figure}[!ht]\centering

\end{figure}

\textbf{Goal:} 
Find $\lambda$ such that $K_I(\lambda)=0$, ``Zero toughness solution''.
Given this we then want to investigate the behaviour for small $K_I\approx 0$.
To do this, take some given value of $\lambda$ and then solve equations
\ref{eq1}, \ref{eq2}.
\subsection*{Discretization of problem}
The method chosen to discretize the problem is to take a vector 
$(x_1, \dots , x_n)$ of $n$ points at which we measure $g', h'$ and have a 
vector $(z_1, \dots ,z_{n-1})$ of $n-1$ intermediate 
points at which $p$ is measured. The spacing chosen is a $\tan^2$ spacing.

The ``obvious'' way to interpolate $h'$ in between the $x_i$'s is 
simple linear interpolation. But both $h',g'$ become singular near 0.
However, we expect a $x^{-1/2}$ singularity, which allows us to ``remove''
said singularity. 
The interpolation used is
\[ g'(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}(a_ix+b_i) &
i <t \\ a_ix+b_i & i \geq t \end{array} \right. \]
for $x$ in the spline $x \in [x_i,x_{i+1}]$. Choose $1 < t < n$, typically
$t=n/2$. Similarly
\[ h'(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}(c_ix+d_i) &
i <t \\ c_ix+d_i & i \geq t \end{array} \right. \]
With the same $t$ used. We will interpolate beyond $x_n$ via 
$g'(x) = a_n x + b_n$, for $x>x_n$, and similar for $h'$.

The values of $g',h'$ are stored via 
\[ \bs{\theta} = \left( \begin{array}{c} a_1x_1+b_1 \\ \vdots 
\\ a_n x_n+b_n \\[4pt] c_1x_1+d_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_n x_n + d_n \end{array} 
\right) \]
Once one has $\bs{\theta}$, it is trivial to recover, say $g'(x_i)$, since
either $g'(x_i) = \bs{\theta}_i$ or $g'(x_i) = \bs{\theta}_i/\sqrt{x_i}$.
Similarly, given $g'(x_i)$; $\bs{\theta}_i$ can be calculated.

\subsection*{Recovering the a$_{i}$'s}
Suppose we know $\bs{\theta}$, (and always assume we know the $x_i$).
Can we recover $a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i$? 
The answer is yes, once we add in the boundary conditions at $\infty$.
Further we have that 
\[ \bs{\gamma} = \left( \begin{array}{c} a_1 \\ \vdots 
\\ a_n \\[3pt] b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \\[3pt] c_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_n 
\\[3pt] d_1 \\ \vdots \\ d_n  \end{array} \right)
= T \bs{\theta} \]
Where T is a $4n \times n$ interpolation matrix. A quick check reveals
we have $4n$ unknowns, in $\bs{\gamma}$. Knowing $\theta$ provides $2n$
equations. Demanding continuity of the interpolated $g',h'$ provides
another $2(n-1)$ equations, (match at $x_2, \dots, x_n$). Finally boundary
conditions on the spline at $\infty$ provide another 2 equations.

The continuity conditions are 
\begin{align*}
a_1 x_2 + b_1 &= a_2 x_2 + b_2 \\
& \;\; \vdots \\
a_{t-2} x_{t-1} + b_{t-2} &= a_{t-1} x_{t-1} + b_{t-1} \\
(a_{t-1} x_{t} + b_{t-1})/\sqrt{x_t} &= a_{t} x_{t} + b_{t} \\
a_{t} x_{t+1} + b_{t} &= a_{t+1} x_{t+1} + b_{t+1} \\
& \;\; \vdots \\
a_{n-1} x_{n} + b_{n-1} &= a_{n} x_{n} + b_{n} \\
\end{align*}
and similar for $c,d$. This means that with the exceptions of
$i=t-1,n$, have that 
\[ \frac{\theta_{i+1}-\theta_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i} = a_i \]
\[ \frac{\theta_{i}\,x_{i+1}-\theta_{i+1}x_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i} = b_i \]
Same idea with $x_{t-1}$, just have to be a little careful about
the switch in the continuity condition,
\[ \frac{\sqrt{x_t}\theta_{t}-\theta_{t-1}}{x_t-x_{t-1}} = a_{t-1} \]
\[ \frac{\theta_{t-1}\,x_t-\theta_t x_{t-1}\sqrt{x_t}}
{x_t-x_{t-1}} = b_{t-1} \]

So we are almost done, just missing 4 rows in our matrix. Have the
$n^{th}$ row as all zeros, i.e. $a_n=0$ due to boundary conditions,
and so trivially the $2n^{th}$ row is 0 except $T_{2n,n} = 1 $
Now, B.C. for $h'$ implies $h''(x_n) \approx h''(x_{n-1})$ i.e.
$c_n=c_{n-1}$ and thus from continuity $d_n=d_{n-1}$. This completes
our interpolation matrix $T$. We still have some extra boundary
conditions to impose, which we will do later. Naively, these
are $g'(x_n) = b_n = 1/2$, $c_n=1$. These are approximately true, but
we need to do a bit better. (I will add this into the explanation
once I understand it$\dots$)  
\\
\subsubsection*{Analytic expressions}
Now that we have made the piecewise analytic approximation\footnote{
I think I have made up some terminology here, piecewise linear isn't
quite right due to the $x^{-1/2}$ parts, and ``sometimes piecewise linear
sometimes piecewise $x^{-1/2}\times$(linear function)'' is not ideal 
either} we can avoid making any more approximations. Recall
$K_{ij}$ has an analytic expression (even better, it's a rational function). 
If we take $h',g'$ to be piecewise
analytic, then the integrand becomes an analytic expression that can
be exactly integrated. For example,

\begin{align*} 
p(z) &= \int_0^{\infty} K_{11}(x-z) g'(x) + K_{12}(x-z) h'(x) \; dx \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{t-1}\int_0^{\infty} K_{11}(x-z)(a_i x+ b_i)/\sqrt x 
 + K_{12}(x-z) (c_ix+d_i)/\sqrt x \; dx \\
&+ \sum_{i=t}^{n}\int_0^{\infty} K_{11}(x-z)(a_i x+ b_i) 
 + K_{12}(x-z) (c_ix+d_i) \; dx
\end{align*}
The right hand side of this equation may look ghastly, (and we haven't
even expanded the $K_{ij}$'s yet $\dots$) but it is an analytic expression
in $z$. Further, we can do the integration before knowing any of the
values of $a,b,c,d$. It is also clear that $p(z)$ is linear in $a,b,c,d$.
Therefore, once we know the spacing of the $z_i$'s we see that 
\[ \left( \begin{array}{c} p(z_1) \\ \vdots \\ p(z_{n-1}) \\[4pt] 0 \\ \vdots \\
0 \end{array} \right) =
\left( \begin{array}{ccc} B_{1,1} & \cdots & B_{1 , 2n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ B_{2(n-1),1} & \cdots & B_{2(n-1) , 2n} 
\end{array}
\right) \bs{\gamma} = BT\bs{\theta} \]
Where the matrix $B$ depends on the choice of spacings ($x, z$), but does
not depend on $\bs{\gamma}$.

We can go further and incorporate the boundary conditions into this equation. 
The discretized versions of the boundary conditions, become
$g'(x_n)=1/2$ and $\displaystyle \frac{h'(x_n)-h'(x_{n-1})}{x_n-x_{n-1}} = 1$.
\footnote{Again, we need to do a bit better than this. For now, this 
illustrates the point.}
These conditions are linear in terms of $g',h'$, and so by adding another two 
rows onto the matrix $BT$, get that
\[ \left( \begin{array}{c} p(z_1) \\ \vdots \\ p(z_{n-1}) \\[4pt] 0 \\ \vdots \\
0 \\ g'(\infty) \\ h''(\infty) \end{array} \right) =
\left( \begin{array}{ccc} A_{1,1} & \cdots & A_{1 , 2n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ A_{2n,1} & \cdots & A_{2n , 2n} 
\end{array}
\right) \bs{\theta}\]
Where $g'(\infty), h''(\infty)$ are the (constant) boundary conditions. 
\\

Now we use the second equation for $p$, namely $p=\int_z^{\infty} 
\lambda/h^2 dx$. We can integrate our piecewise analytic expression
for $h'$ to recover $h$, imposing both $h(x_1)=0$ as well as continuity at the
$x_i$ for $i=2,\dots n$. The result is 
\[ h(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} \sqrt{x}(w_ix+e_i)+r_i &
i <t \\ w_ix^2+e_ix + r_i & i \geq t \end{array} \right. \]
for some constants $w,e,r$. These constants are related to $\bs{\gamma}$,
and so $\bs{\theta}$, linearly. Given this piecewise analytic expression
for $h$, we can find an analytic expression for $p(z)$. Since we know the
spacings, we have
\[ f(\bs{\theta}) = \left( \begin{array}{c} p(z_1) \\ \vdots \\ p(z_{n-1}) 
\\[4pt] 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ g'(\infty) \\ h''(\infty) \end{array} \right) =
 A  \bs{\theta} \]
Where we now just need to solve for $\bs{\theta}$.

\subsection*{Newton's method}
Suppose $\bs{\theta}$ is iterate 1. To get the next iterate you need to solve 
(to first order)
\[ f(\bs{\theta}+\delta\bs{\theta}) = A(\bs{\theta}+\delta \bs{\theta})\]
\[ f(\bs{\theta}) + (Df|_{\bs{\theta}})(\delta\bs{\theta}) = A\bs{\theta}+
A\delta \bs{\theta}\]
Where $Df|_{\bs{\theta}}$ is a matrix of partial derivatives. Therefore, get to 
first order that 
\[ \delta \bs{\theta} =  (A-Df|_{\bs{\theta}})^{-1}(f(\bs{\theta}) - A\bs{\theta}) \]

Ingredients:
\begin{itemize}
\item Matrix $A$ itself (of which the $2(n-1)\times2n$ part is the integral
      kernel)
\item The function $f(\bs{\theta})$. I.e. given $\bs{\theta}$ you need to calculate
      $\int_z^{\infty}\lambda/h^2 dx$ (Key functions ``hprime\_to\_h'' and
      ``hprime\_to\_p'').
\item Need to calculate $Df$ which involves calculating $\displaystyle \frac
      {\partial} {\partial \bs{\theta}} \int_z^{\infty} \frac{\lambda}{h(x)^2}dx$

\end{itemize}
So we have worked out numerically $K(\lambda)$, now we want to solve 
$K(\lambda_0)=0$ for $\lambda_0$. We do a ``march''. Sublety in that $K<0$ is 
unphysical, so a guess of $\lambda>\lambda_0$ where $K(\lambda_0)=0$ does
not make any physical sense (\& will get bad numerical results). To get 
around this difficulty, take the next iterate of $\lambda$ as smaller than
predicted.
\begin{figure}[!ht]\centering
\caption{March to find $\lambda_0$}
\includegraphics{NumFig1.pdf}\label{March}
\end{figure}

For example in Figure \ref{March}, the obvious choice for $\lambda_4$
(the light blue circle) is larger than the true value of $\lambda_0$, 
and therefore the naive extrapolation method won't quite work.

Important note: What I have called $\bs{\theta}$ in this document is
(confusingly) called hprime in the code. From now on I will call it
$\bs{h}'$, in bold to try to avoid confusion.
