This function is given $h,x,z$ ($h$ in the form of the h\_coeff vector)
and returns 
$\displaystyle \frac{1}{\lambda} \left( \begin{array}{c} p(z_1) \\ \vdots \\
p(z_{n-1}) \end{array} \right) $ via the equation $\displaystyle p =-\lambda
 \int_z^{\infty} \frac{1}{h^2} dx$
\\

Again, once one has made the approximation of $h$ as piecewise analytic, can 
actually work out the exact integrals. So all this function really has to do
is to evaluate some known functions, plugging in the values of h\_coeff.
