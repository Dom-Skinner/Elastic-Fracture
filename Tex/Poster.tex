\begin{myblock}{Introduction}
Consider a semi-infinite elastic solid with a thin strip peeled off, and the
resulting crack filled with an incompressible fluid. The motion is driven
by a bending moment applied to the ``arm'' of the solid. The aim is to be
able to write down a set of equations governing the dynamics, in particular
it is of interest to examine the relationship between the speed of traveling
wave solutions $c$, the magnitude of the bending moment $M$, and the toughness 
of the solid $K_I$. 

Relevant physical problems include both igneous intrusions beneath a volcano,
and the formation of hydrofractures in an oil
reservoir, since both involve the propagation of a crack through a brittle 
elastic solid driven by fluid injection.

$g(x)$ the horizontal displacement, $h(x)$ the vertical displacement, and
$\ell$ is the thickness of the arm.}
\end{figure}
\end{myblock}\vfill
\begin{myblock}{Governing Equations}
We assume that the flow everywhere satisfies the lubrication equations. From 
fluid mechanics, we then get the equation
\[12\mu c = h(x)^2 \frac{dp}{dx}\]
Where $p(x)$ is the pressure, and $\mu$ the viscosity.

From elasticity, using Muskhelishiveli methods, we can derive the equation
\[
\left( \begin{array}{c} p \\ 0 \end{array} \right)   =
\frac{E}{4\pi (1-\nu^2)} \int_0^{\infty}
\left(\begin{array}{cc} K_{11}(x-\tilde{x}) & K_{12}(x-\tilde{x}) \\ 
K_{21}(x-\tilde{x}) & K_{22}(x-\tilde{x}) \end{array} \right)
\left( \begin{array}{c} g'(\tilde{x}) \\ h'(\tilde{x}) \end{array} 
\right)d\tilde{x}  \]
Where $K_{ij}$ is the integral kernel specific to this geometry, $E$ is the
Young's modulus, $\nu$ is Poisson's ratio. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Boundary conditions as $x\to\infty$ are governed by the bending moment.
      For large $x$ the geometry is well approximated by beam theory. This 
      gives the equation 
      \[ M(x) = \frac{E\ell^3}{12(1-\nu^2)}\frac{d^2h}{dx^2} \]
      Where $M(x)$ tends to a constant bending moment as $x\to \infty$.
\item The boundary conditions as $x\to0$ are governed by ``\emph{Linear Elastic
      Fracture Mechanics}'', (LEFM). This gives the condition
      \[K_I = \lim_{x\to 0} \; \frac{E}{1-\nu^2}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{8}} \sqrt{x}
      h'(x) \]
\end{itemize}
We move into dimensionless variables now
\[(x,h,g,p,K_I,K_{ij}) \to (\xi, H,G,\Pi, \kappa, \Lambda_{ij}) \]
Where the new equations and boundary conditions become
\[(\Pi,0) = \int \Lambda \cdot (G',H') d\xi, \quad H^2\Pi' = \lambda\]
\[\lim_{\xi \to \infty} H'' = 1, \quad \lim_{\xi \to 0} 3\sqrt{2\pi}H' 
= \kappa \]
\end{myblock}\vfill
\begin{myblock}{Zero Toughness Solution}
Instead of tackling the general problem, (which we expect to not have an
analytic solution) we investigate the case where $\kappa \ll 1$,
the ``\emph{small toughness solution}.'' Perhaps an even simpler problem to 
consider is the ``\emph{zero toughness solution}'' for $\kappa=0$. 
However, we have the following dichotomy,
\begin{itemize}
\item For $\kappa=0$, one can show that the leading order behaviour
      as $\xi\to 0$ is $H(\xi) \sim \xi^{2/3}$
\item For any $\kappa > 0$, no matter how small, near 
      $\xi=0$, $H(\xi)\sim \xi^{1/2}$
\end{itemize}

\begin{myblock}{Small Toughness Solution}
Here we take after Garagash and Detournay \cite{GandD}. Their paper examines
a similar problem of fluid driven fracture in a different geometry, with the
propagation being driven by fluid injection. They construct a small toughness
solution in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item Near the tip there is the ``LEFM boundary layer'' which accounts for the
      $h \sim x^{1/2}$ behaviour, and does not resemble the zero toughness 
     solution.
\item Away from the tip, the solution behaves as 
      \[h(x) = h_0(x) + \cE(K_I)h_1(x)+o(\cE)\]
      where $h_0$ is  the zero toughness solution, and $\cE(K_I)$ is an
      as yet unknown function of $K_I$. (Similar for $p$,$g$).
\end{itemize}
We can do a similar construction, after moving into dimensionless variables:
\[(x,h,g,p,K_I,K_{ij}) \to (\xi, H,G,\Pi, \kappa, \Lambda_{ij}) \]
Where the new equations and boundary conditions become
\[(\Pi,0) = \int \Lambda \cdot (G',H') d\xi, \quad H^2\Pi' = \lambda, \quad
\lim_{\xi \to \infty} H'' = 1, \quad \lim_{\xi \to 0} 3\sqrt{2\pi}H' = \kappa \]
We look for a solution like $H(\xi) = H_0(\xi) + \cE(\kappa)
H_1(\xi)+o(\cE)$ (and again similar for $\Pi$,$G$).

By matching the outer asymptotics of the LEFM boundary layer solution, and
the inner asymptotics of the expansion in $\cE$, in a region that they overlap,
one can show that $\cE = C \kappa^{4-6s}\lambda_0^{2s-1}$. $s \approx 0.1386$
comes from solving a transcendental equation, $C$ can be determined numerically,
and $\lambda_0$ is the value of $\lambda$ when $\kappa=0$, also determined
numerically.

\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Fig7.pdf}
\caption{Matching region of outer and inner asymptotics.}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
An additional problem not present in \cite{GandD} is the asymptotic region
as $\xi\to \infty$, but it can be shown that with our rescaling, this does
not affect the near tip behaviour.
\end{myblock}\vfill
\begin{myblock}{Numerical Solution of Equations}
The set of scaled equations can be discritized, and then solved numerically
as follows. We choose a set of points $\xi$ to measure $G,H$, and an 
intermediate set of points $z$ to measure $\Pi$, so $\xi_1 < z_1 < \xi_2 <
\dots < z_{n-1} < \xi_n$.
The simplest thing to do, would be to approximate $H',G'$ as piecewise linear
functions. However, since both $H'$,$G'$ are singular near the origin, they
are badly approximated by linear functions.
The solution is to approximate $G'(\xi) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\xi}}(a_i \xi + b_i)$
near the tip and to approximate $G'(\xi) = a_i \xi + b_i$ away from the tip 
for $\xi_i < \xi < \xi_{i+1}$ (similar with $H'$). We store the values 
$\theta = (a_1 \xi_1 + b_1, \dots , a_n \xi_n +b_n)$.
\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Fig9.pdf}
\caption{Relative improvement in interpolation for a given number of points,
once known singular behaviour is accounted for.}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
Once we have the values $\theta$, it is possible to linearly recover
the coefficients, i.e. $(a_1,\dots, a_n,b_1,\dots , b_n) = T \theta$ where
$T$ is some matrix. It is clear, given this interpolation, the elasticity
integral depends linearly on the $\theta$ values.
We can rewrite the lubrication integral as  
$\Pi(z) = \int_{z}^{\infty} \lambda/H^2 d\xi$. This depends non-linearly
on the $\theta$ values. 

There are now two different expressions for $(\Pi(z_1) , \dots , \Pi(z_{n-1}))$,
so $n-1$ equations. There
are an additional $n-1$ equations from the elasticity integral. We can get
another two equations from the boundary conditions as $\xi\to\infty$.
This gives $2n$ equations for $2n$ unknowns ($\theta$ and $H'$ equivalent).
This is enough to solve the problem using Newton's method, to give $G',H'$.
We use $\lambda$ as an input parameter and solve for $\kappa$, although in
the physical problem we think of $\kappa$ as the independent variable.
\end{myblock}\vfill
\begin{myblock}{Results}
\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
The relationship $\lambda = \lambda_0 + \cE(\kappa) \lambda_1$ holds
well in practice. It has been calculated that $\lambda_0 \approx 0.0591$,
To calculate $\lambda_1,C$ is harder, since the linear perturbation problem
must be solved (linearise and  work only to first order in $\cE$). We found
$C \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-3}$, $\lambda_1 \approx -0.31$. Redimensionalising
\[ c = \frac{36(1-\nu^2)^2M^3}{\pi \mu E^2 \ell^5}\left(\lambda_0 + C 
\lambda_0^{2s-1}\lambda_1 (\ell^{3/2}K_I/M)^{4-6s} \right) \]
